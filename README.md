# RestAPIwithMongoose
Lab 4 Rest API with Mongoose EDX

1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?

I created the server.js file which holds the mongoose connection and model information.  I used express, morgan, error-handler, body-parsor, and mongoose npm modules.  Morgan, error-hanler, and body parser are my middleware, plus storing the mongoose model to be used in my routes file.  I created a routes file to store all my logic for CRUD activity with mongoose.

2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? If you used any specific curl requests, let us know.

I used the below curl requests to test my REST API along with validating the data in mongodb via mongoui.

3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewers can know ahead of time

Everything works as expected as far as I know.  I am still great at error handling so that potentially could have been better.


Curl Tests

//posts account data

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"balance": "1000", "name": "savings"}' "http://localhost:3000/accounts"

//gets all account data

curl "http://localhost:3000/accounts"

//gets 1 account data

curl "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id"  where id = valid id

//updates account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"balance": "1500"}' "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id"

//deletes account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command

curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id"
